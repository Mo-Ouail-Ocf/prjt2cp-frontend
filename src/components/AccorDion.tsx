                <AccordionContent>
                  Tikta, derived from the Amazigh word meaning 'Idea,' is a
                  platform dedicated to the collection and development of ideas.
                  Our website is built upon the principles of brainstorming and
                  brain-writing techniques. We provide a collaborative space
                  where users can contribute, refine, and nurture innovative
                  concepts to fruition.

                  Brainstorming:
                  <br />
                  Brainstorming is a creative problem-solving technique where a
                  group of individuals generates ideas spontaneously and without
                  judgment, typically in a collaborative setting. The focus is
                  on quantity rather than quality, aiming to spark creativity
                  and innovation through free-flowing idea generation.
                  <br />
                  Brain-writing:
                  <br />
                  Brain-writing is a structured approach to idea generation
                  where participants individually and silently write down their
                  ideas on paper or digital platforms. After a designated time,
                  ideas are shared with the group, allowing for simultaneous
                  contribution from all participants and reducing the influence
                  of dominant voices. This method encourages equal participation
                  and often leads to a diverse range of creative suggestions.
